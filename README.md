The web is constantly evolving and this new phase, web 3.0, it’s about getting the web more connected, more open and more intelligent; to have the data linked. So La Liga Prediction is adapting the statistical models to predict football matches results with semantic web standards and protocols to make sure it’s aligned with the new web wave and it can be shared and used by different parties without restrictions. The goal is to introduce the semantic web to the online gambling world and make our ontology the new standard to be shared to all the companies and individuals in the area. This will simplify the process and will allow companies to share data from multiple sources in a seamless manner, so companies can focus on the design and implementation of more sophisticated algorithms which potentially have other applications in other fields.
